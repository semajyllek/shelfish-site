        <p>The document was generated with claude4.0, a tool from Anthropic, but was reviewed by me, James Kelly, the creator of shelfish.
			This part was hand-written by me: 
        </p>
        <p>
			I deeply care about privacy and we will only collect names for payment and leaderboard purposes.
			The leaderboard is opt-in. You can opt-out at any time. 
			
			We do not share your pictures, though may open that up for opt-in at some time if users request it.
			We do keep the pictures and associated labels for model training purposes. Please be careful about what you scan.
			If you unintentionally scan something you do not want to share, please email us and we will delete it. 
			
			We do not share your email with anyone except for the leaderboard and payment processing.
			We do not share your detailed book data with anyone, though may open that up for opt-in at some time if users request it.
			We do not and will never collect data outside of the direct data shared by the user in the app.
